# Cycle 0008 — Evaluate src/params.rs usefulness and possible refactor (2025-09-07T11-52-49)


Use this template before editing code. Keep it short and decisive. Save a copy as `$GITROOT/.agents/cycles/<idx>.<short-desc>.<timestamp>.md` to log each cycle.

1) Summary

- Problem/intent:
  Evaluate whether `src/params.rs` adds value as a separate module; if not, refactor its tiny `build_report_params` to a more cohesive location with `ReportParams`.
- Deliverables (code/docs/tests):
  Code refactor moving builder; delete `src/params.rs`; update imports; run tests + strict spacing audit; document decision here.
- Scope (modules/files/areas):
  `src/params.rs`, `src/render.rs`, `src/range_processor.rs`, `src/main.rs`.

2) Context & Constraints

- Domain context (what system does):
  Git activity reporter generating JSON reports; `ReportParams` lives in `render.rs` and is consumed widely.
- Primary consumers (humans/services):
  Internal modules; no public crate API guarantees beyond binary.
- External contracts (APIs/schemas/CLIs):
  Keep `ReportParams` fields stable; no CLI changes.

3) State & Invariants

- State variables (k: description):
  cfg: normalized `EffectiveConfig`; ranges: resolved `LabeledRange`s.
- Derived state (computed once):
  Default label from `WindowSpec`; `split_out` when `out != "-"`.
- Invariants (pre/post, must always hold):
  Builder is pure; moving location must not change behavior.

4) Inputs → Outputs (Contracts)

- Inputs (flags, env, APIs, files):
- Outputs (files, API responses, console):
- Naming/shape contracts (stable filenames/paths; schema versions; pointer shapes):

5) Orchestration Plan (Phases)

- Phase 1 — Normalize/build inputs:
  Read `src/params.rs` and call sites; confirm single use.
- Phase 2 — Resolve/derive:
  Choose target: co-locate with `ReportParams` in `render.rs` for cohesion.
- Phase 3 — Process units (loop): generate → save/persist → index
  Move function; update imports; delete module; compile + test; run spacing audit.
- Finalize — aggregate/manifest → emit/return
  Record outcomes; rationale and diffs kept minimal.

6) Module/Boundary Plan

- Resolution/parser module(s):
- Processing/orchestrator module(s):
- Assembly/rendering module(s):
- Persistence/manifest module(s):
- Enrichment/integration module(s):
- Utilities/helpers:

7) Side Effects & IO

- Filesystem (paths, write strategy):
- Network/API calls (best-effort vs. required):
- Subprocess/system calls:
- Concurrency decisions:

8) Testing & Validation

- Unit tests (pure helpers):
- Contract tests (schemas/pointers/naming):
- Integration tests (end-to-end scenarios):
- Manual checks (smoke/paths/outputs):

9) Risks & Trade-offs

- Purity vs. performance:
- Stability vs. ergonomics:
- Backward compatibility/migration:

10) Tie-Breakers (apply in this order)

1. Contract stability (filenames/schemas/protocols)
2. Orchestration simplicity (single loop, explicit state)
3. Correctness/testability (pure helpers, invariants)
4. Performance (avoid duplicate heavy work)
5. Minimal diff/readability

11) Observability & Rollback

- Logs/metrics/counters:
- Pointer/evidence to outputs:
- Rollback plan:

Decisions
- `src/params.rs` was a single 1-function module, only used by `range_processor.rs`. Separating it obscured cohesion: the builder is conceptually tied to `ReportParams` (defined in `render.rs`).
- Move `build_report_params` into `render.rs` next to the type; update caller to `use crate::render::build_report_params;`; remove `mod params;` from `main.rs` and delete `src/params.rs`.

Changes
- Added `build_report_params` to `src/render.rs` with unchanged logic.
- Updated `src/range_processor.rs` import and kept usage intact.
- Removed `src/params.rs`; removed `mod params;` from `src/main.rs`.

Validation
- `just test` passes locally.
- `just audit-spacing-strict` reports clean.

Notes
- Kept minimal diff; behavior unchanged. Future: consider an associated `ReportParams::from_cfg` builder to reduce free-function sprawl.

States (define enumerated program states here):
- [fill: e.g., single, multi, write, preview, split, monolithic]

Modules → Roles (from file headers):
- src/commit.rs: commit construction/enrichment — Construct per-commit objects; enrich with optional PR links; embed or save patches as configured
- src/gitio.rs: git/io-helpers — Provide thin, robust wrappers around `git` CLI to retrieve commit metadata, diffs, stats, and branch info for report generation
- src/util.rs: utilities/helpers — Utilities for paths, time formatting, spacing-safe helpers, and man page rendering
- src/render.rs: assembly/render — Assemble per-range reports; when split_apart, write commit shards and per-range report, returning a pointer
- src/enrich.rs: enrichment/coordinator — Coordinator to apply configured enrichments; keeps orchestration separate from enrichment implementations
- src/manifest.rs: persistence/manifest — Build and write overall manifest for multi-range runs
- src/params.rs: parameter mapping — Translate EffectiveConfig + [since,until] into ReportParams for render
- src/main.rs: entrypoint/orchestrator — Entrypoint orchestrator; normalize → resolve ranges → process ranges; print final JSON or pointer
- src/range_windows.rs: resolution/parser — Resolve time windows into labeled ranges; parse "now" overrides; helpers for natural language buckets
- src/range_processor.rs: processing/orchestrator — Orchestrate per-range processing: generate report JSON and save artifacts; assemble overall manifest for multi-range runs
- src/model.rs: model/types — Define the JSON model (commits, ranges, manifests, GitHub PRs) shared by rendering and enrichment
- src/cli.rs: cli/normalization — Parse CLI flags and produce an EffectiveConfig with consistent defaults and implied flags
- src/ext/mod.rs: module/aggregation — Group extension traits and helpers for third-party crates and std types under a single `ext` namespace
- src/ext/serde_json.rs: extension/serde_json — Provide ergonomic nested JSON fetching via dotted paths and safe typed extraction for serde_json::Value
- src/enrichment/github_api.rs: enrichment/github-api — Isolated GitHub API helpers used by enrichment (token discovery, REST calls)
- src/enrichment/github_pull_requests.rs: enrichment/integration — Best-effort enrichment adding GitHub PR links and PR list to a commit
- src/enrichment/mod.rs: enrichment/namespace — Namespace for enrichment features (GitHub PRs, etc.)

Module Outputs (from file headers):

- src/enrichment/github_pull_requests.rs → Mutated commit.patch_ref (diff/patch URLs) and commit.github_prs
- src/enrichment/mod.rs → Public submodules implementing specific enrichments

Module Invariants (from file headers):
- src/commit.rs
  - clip_patch preserves UTF-8 boundaries; patch_clipped is accurate
  - body_lines derived when body is non-empty
  - enrichment is best-effort; absence of PRs leaves fields None
- src/util.rs
  - prepare_out_dir returns an existing directory (either provided or temp timestamped)
  - clip_patch never splits UTF-8; indicates clipping accurately
  - format_shard_name pattern is stable and locale-independent
- src/render.rs
  - run_simple returns fully in-memory report consistent with schema
  - run_report returns pointer JSON when split; otherwise full report JSON; file names are stable
  - shard filenames follow YYYY.MM.DD-HH.MM-<shortsha>.json
- src/manifest.rs
  - manifest contains ranges[] in chronological order of entries provided
  - file paths in entries are relative to base_dir and point to report-<label>.json
  - generated_at is serialized in %Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S (local)
- src/params.rs
  - label derives from window type (Month => ym; else "window") unless overridden later
  - split_out is set when out != "-"; otherwise resolved by render
- src/main.rs
  - when cfg.multi_windows == true, an overall manifest.json is written and a pointer with {dir, manifest} is printed
  - when cfg.split_apart == true and cfg.multi_windows == false, a pointer {dir, file} is printed for the range report
  - when cfg.split_apart == false and cfg.multi_windows == false, a full JSON report is printed to stdout or written to --out
- src/range_windows.rs
  - resolve_ranges returns at least one range; ForPhrase buckets are ordered earliest→latest
  - month_bounds yields [start_of_month, start_of_next_month]
  - parse_now accepts RFC3339 or naive %Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S and never panics
- src/range_processor.rs
  - base_dir is prepared when split_apart || multi_windows
  - per-range report file name is report-<label>.json when written to disk
  - multi_windows ⇒ manifest.json exists and pointer {dir, manifest} printed
  - single split ⇒ pointer {dir, file} printed; single non-split ⇒ JSON printed or written to --out
- src/cli.rs
  - exactly one window selection is provided: --month | --for | (--since & --until)
  - --detailed implies include_unmerged/include_patch/github_prs
  - out semantics: file path when single non-split; directory when split or multi
- src/enrichment/github_api.rs
  - Never panic; return None/empty on failures (best-effort enrichment)
  - Token discovery prefers GITHUB_TOKEN, then `gh auth token`
  - Origin parser only recognizes GitHub remotes (https or ssh)
- src/enrichment/github_pull_requests.rs
  - On success, preserves existing commit fields; sets URLs if present in first PR; attaches PR list
  - On failure, commit remains valid; fields untouched

Acceptance (checklist to adapt):
- [ ] Program state derived once and stored centrally
- [ ] Outputs mapped to enumerated states
- [ ] Names/shapes stable and test-covered
- [ ] Orchestrator phases clear; IO at edges
- [ ] Invariants defined and asserted
- [ ] Errors include what/where
- [ ] Observability: pointers/ids/paths logged/printed
