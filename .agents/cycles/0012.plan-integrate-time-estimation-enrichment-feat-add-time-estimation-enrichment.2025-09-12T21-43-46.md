# Cycle 0012 — plan: integrate time estimation enrichment (feat/add-time-estimation-enrichment) (2025-09-12T21-43-46)


Use this template before editing code. Keep it short and decisive. Save a copy as `$GITROOT/.agents/cycles/<idx>.<short-desc>.<timestamp>.md` to log each cycle.

1) Summary

- Problem/intent:
  - Incorporate the time‑estimation enrichment from `feat/add-time-estimation-enrichment` safely on top of `main`. Due to heavy divergence (model/cli/render) and known merge conflicts, prefer a clean re‑implementation that preserves current contracts and layout rules.

- Deliverables (code/docs/tests):
  - New pure module: `src/enrichment/effort.rs` (commit/PR estimators).
  - CLI flag: `--estimate-effort` (opt‑in; implied by `--detailed`).
  - Additive optional fields on `Commit` and `GithubPullRequest`: `estimated_minutes`, `estimated_minutes_min`, `estimated_minutes_max`, `estimate_confidence`, `estimate_basis`.
  - Wiring in `commit.rs` (commit estimate) and post‑loop PR pass.
  - Unit + integration tests; schema updates to allow optional fields; docs/man refresh.

- Scope (modules/files/areas):
  - Add: `src/enrichment/effort.rs` (+ tests).
  - Touch: `src/model.rs`, `src/cli.rs`, `src/commit.rs`, `src/enrichment/mod.rs`, and minimal `src/render.rs` for PR pass; `tests/schemas/*`, `tests/integration/*`, `README.md`, `docs/man`.

2) Context & Constraints

- Domain context (what system does):
  - Export Git activity to JSON with optional enrichment; estimations are explainable best‑effort hints.

- Primary consumers (humans/services):
  - Report‑writer agents and humans consuming JSON/Markdown outputs.

- External contracts (APIs/schemas/CLIs):
  - JSON Schemas remain backward‑compatible; new fields are additive/optional. CLI coherence with `--detailed` maintained.

3) State & Invariants

- State variables (k: description):
  - `estimate_enabled` (bool), `weights`/`params` (in‑mem defaults).

- Derived state (computed once):
  - `range_commits` vector for PR estimates across the window.

- Invariants (pre/post, must always hold):
  - Only additive schema changes; no breaking renames.
  - Estimation is pure (no IO/network), deterministic, panic‑free.
  - Author enforced spacing/layout; one blank between compute/IO/push.

4) Inputs → Outputs (Contracts)

- Inputs (flags, env, APIs, files):
  - Flags: `--estimate-effort` (opt‑in). Hidden tuning knobs deferred.
  - Env/APIs: none new; reuse existing GitHub enrichment data.

- Outputs (files, API responses, console):
  - Commit/PR objects gain optional estimation fields when enabled.

- Naming/shape contracts (stable filenames/paths; schema versions; pointer shapes):
  - Field names: `estimated_minutes`, `estimated_minutes_min`, `estimated_minutes_max`, `estimate_confidence`, `estimate_basis` (minutes as unit).

5) Orchestration Plan (Phases)

- Phase 1 — Normalize/build inputs:
  - Parse CLI → `estimate_enabled` in config.

- Phase 2 — Resolve/derive:
  - Build `ReportParams` carrying `estimate_enabled`.

- Phase 3 — Process units (loop): generate → save/persist → index
  - Build `Commit`; if enabled, attach commit estimate.
  - If GitHub enrichment present and enabled, compute PR estimates after loop using range commits.

- Finalize — aggregate/manifest → emit/return
  - No filename/manifest changes; totals deferred to future cycle.

6) Module/Boundary Plan

- Resolution/parser module(s): `src/cli.rs`.
- Processing/orchestrator module(s): `src/commit.rs` (commit estimate), `src/render.rs` (PR pass).
- Assembly/rendering module(s): unchanged.
- Persistence/manifest module(s): unchanged.
- Enrichment/integration module(s): `src/enrichment/effort.rs`; export in `src/enrichment/mod.rs`.
- Utilities/helpers: none new.

7) Side Effects & IO

- Filesystem (paths, write strategy): none new.
- Network/API calls (best-effort vs. required): none; uses in‑memory data.
- Subprocess/system calls: none.
- Concurrency decisions: unchanged; estimators are cheap.

8) Testing & Validation

- Unit tests (pure helpers): estimator math (rename/test discounts; reviews; multi‑day drag; cycle‑time cap).
- Contract tests (schemas/pointers/naming): add optional fields to schemas.
- Integration tests (end-to-end scenarios): CLI with `--estimate-effort --detailed` over fixture; assert fields exist and sane.
- Manual checks (smoke/paths/outputs): `just run-simple`, `just man`.

9) Risks & Trade-offs

- Purity vs. performance: pure helpers; negligible overhead.
- Stability vs. ergonomics: minimal CLI surface; defer knobs.
- Backward compatibility/migration: additive, flag‑gated; schemas updated.

10) Tie-Breakers (apply in this order)

1. Contract stability (filenames/schemas/protocols)
2. Orchestration simplicity (single loop, explicit state)
3. Correctness/testability (pure helpers, invariants)
4. Performance (avoid duplicate heavy work)
5. Minimal diff/readability

11) Observability & Rollback

- Logs/metrics/counters: none; `estimate_basis` string offers explainability.
- Pointer/evidence to outputs: fields appear only when flag set.
- Rollback plan: revert wiring commit or simply stop populating fields; helpers remain for later use.

Modules → Roles (from file headers):
- src/commit.rs: commit construction/enrichment — Construct per-commit objects; enrich with optional PR links; embed or save patches as configured
- src/gitio.rs: git/io-helpers — Provide thin, robust wrappers around `git` CLI to retrieve commit metadata, diffs, stats, and branch info for report generation
- src/util.rs: utilities/helpers — Utilities for paths, time formatting, spacing-safe helpers, and man page rendering
- src/render.rs: assembly/render — Assemble per-range reports; when split_apart, write commit shards and per-range report, returning a pointer
- src/enrich.rs: enrichment/coordinator — Coordinator to apply configured enrichments; keeps orchestration separate from enrichment implementations
- src/manifest.rs: persistence/manifest — Build and write overall manifest for multi-range runs
- src/main.rs: entrypoint/orchestrator — Entrypoint orchestrator; normalize → resolve ranges → process ranges; print final JSON or pointer
- src/range_windows.rs: resolution/parser — Resolve time windows into labeled ranges; parse "now" overrides; helpers for natural language buckets
- src/range_processor.rs: processing/orchestrator — Orchestrate per-range processing: generate report JSON and save artifacts; assemble overall manifest for multi-range runs
- src/model.rs: model/types — Define the JSON model (commits, ranges, manifests, GitHub PRs) shared by rendering and enrichment
- src/cli.rs: cli/normalization — Parse CLI flags and produce an EffectiveConfig with consistent defaults and implied flags
- src/ext/mod.rs: module/aggregation — Group extension traits and helpers for third-party crates and std types under a single `ext` namespace

Module Invariants (from file headers):
- src/commit.rs
  - clip_patch preserves UTF-8 boundaries; patch_clipped is accurate
  - body_lines derived when body is non-empty
  - enrichment is best-effort; absence of PRs leaves fields None
- src/util.rs
  - prepare_out_dir returns an existing directory (either provided or temp timestamped)
  - clip_patch never splits UTF-8; indicates clipping accurately
  - format_shard_name pattern is stable and locale-independent
- src/render.rs
  - run_simple returns fully in-memory report consistent with schema
  - run_report returns pointer JSON when split; otherwise full report JSON; file names are stable
  - shard filenames follow YYYY.MM.DD-HH.MM-<shortsha>.json
- src/manifest.rs
  - manifest contains ranges[] in chronological order of entries provided
  - file paths in entries are relative to base_dir and point to report-<label>.json
  - generated_at is serialized in %Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S (local)
- src/main.rs
  - when cfg.multi_windows == true, an overall manifest.json is written and a pointer with {dir, manifest} is printed
  - when cfg.split_apart == true and cfg.multi_windows == false, a pointer {dir, file} is printed for the range report
  - when cfg.split_apart == false and cfg.multi_windows == false, a full JSON report is printed to stdout or written to --out
- src/range_windows.rs
  - resolve_ranges returns at least one range; ForPhrase buckets are ordered earliest→latest
  - month_bounds yields [start_of_month, start_of_next_month]
  - parse_now accepts RFC3339 or naive %Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S and never panics
- src/range_processor.rs
  - base_dir is prepared when split_apart || multi_windows
  - per-range report file name is report-<label>.json when written to disk
  - multi_windows ⇒ manifest.json exists and pointer {dir, manifest} printed
  - single split ⇒ pointer {dir, file} printed; single non-split ⇒ JSON printed or written to --out
- src/cli.rs
  - exactly one window selection is provided: --month | --for | (--since & --until)
  - --detailed implies include_unmerged/include_patch/github_prs
  - out semantics: file path when single non-split; directory when split or multi
- src/enrichment/github_api.rs
  - Never panic; return None/empty on failures (best-effort enrichment)
  - Token discovery prefers GITHUB_TOKEN, then `gh auth token`
  - Origin parser only recognizes GitHub remotes (https or ssh)
- src/enrichment/github_pull_requests.rs
  - On success, preserves existing commit fields; sets URLs if present in first PR; attaches PR list
  - On failure, commit remains valid; fields untouched

Acceptance (checklist to adapt):
- [ ] Program state derived once and stored centrally
- [ ] Outputs mapped to enumerated states
- [ ] Names/shapes stable and test-covered
- [ ] Orchestrator phases clear; IO at edges
- [ ] Invariants defined and asserted
- [ ] Errors include what/where
- [ ] Observability: pointers/ids/paths logged/printed
