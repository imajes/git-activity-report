# Cycle 0011 — refactor range_processor helpers & spacing (2025-09-09T14-19-55)


Use this template before editing code. Keep it short and decisive. Save a copy as `$GITROOT/.agents/cycles/<idx>.<short-desc>.<timestamp>.md` to log each cycle.

1) Summary

- Problem/intent:
  - Reduce branching and inline complexity in `range_processor.rs` by extracting helpers for filename resolution and output emission, keeping spacing/layout invariants.
- Deliverables (code/docs/tests):
  - Code refactor (no schema/output changes), cycle log update.
- Scope (modules/files/areas):
  - `src/range_processor.rs`; `.agents/cycles/0011*`.

2) Context & Constraints

- Domain context (what system does):
  - Git activity report generator producing stable JSON reports and manifests.
- Primary consumers (humans/services):
  - Humans (CLI), downstream tools validating against `tests/schemas/*`.
- External contracts (APIs/schemas/CLIs):
  - Stable JSON schemas; CLI flags behavior; file naming conventions.

3) State & Invariants

- State variables (k: description):
  - `cfg`: normalized CLI settings; `range`: labeled window; `report_json`.
- Derived state (computed once):
  - `file_rel` for manifest/report naming when applicable.
- Invariants (pre/post, must always hold):
  - No schema/field changes; filenames `report-<label>.json` when non-split disk writes.
  - Spacing/layout rules (blank between compute→I/O and assign→push patterns).

4) Inputs → Outputs (Contracts)

- Inputs (flags, env, APIs, files):
  - `--out`, `--split-apart`, `--multi-windows`; repo path; optional env (fixtures).
- Outputs (files, API responses, console):
  - Per-range report files and/or stdout JSON; optional manifest entries.
- Naming/shape contracts (stable filenames/paths; schema versions; pointer shapes):
  - `report-<label>.json` under dir-like outputs; pointer `{dir,file}` or `{dir,manifest}` unchanged.

5) Orchestration Plan (Phases)

- Phase 1 — Normalize/build inputs:
  - N/A for this refactor (consumes existing normalized `cfg`/`range`).
- Phase 2 — Resolve/derive:
  - Extract `resolve_file_rel(...)` from save logic.
- Phase 3 — Process units (loop): generate → save/persist → index
  - Extract `write_or_print(...)` to encapsulate out-dir/file logic and zero-commit print behavior.
- Finalize — aggregate/manifest → emit/return
  - Keep manifest entry assembly intact; no behavior change.

6) Module/Boundary Plan

- Resolution/parser module(s):
- Processing/orchestrator module(s):
- Assembly/rendering module(s):
- Persistence/manifest module(s):
- Enrichment/integration module(s):
- Utilities/helpers:
  - New helpers live in `range_processor.rs` (local-only scope; no public API changes).

7) Side Effects & IO

- Filesystem (paths, write strategy):
  - Preserve existing behavior; ensure `create_dir_all` before writes; return JSON to print when commit count is zero.
- Network/API calls (best-effort vs. required):
  - None introduced.
- Subprocess/system calls:
  - None introduced.
- Concurrency decisions:
  - None changed.

8) Testing & Validation

- Unit tests (pure helpers):
  - Existing tests cover `save_range_report` behavior; helpers are exercised transitively.
- Contract tests (schemas/pointers/naming):
  - No schema changes; snapshots remain valid.
- Integration tests (end-to-end scenarios):
  - Local `cargo build` OK; full test run depends on git fixtures/environment.
- Manual checks (smoke/paths/outputs):
  - Spacing audit `just audit-spacing` and headers `just check-headers` passed.

9) Risks & Trade-offs

- Purity vs. performance:
  - Neutral; minor function boundaries only.
- Stability vs. ergonomics:
  - Improves readability; keeps behavior stable.
- Backward compatibility/migration:
  - Internal-only refactor; no CLI/JSON contract changes.

10) Tie-Breakers (apply in this order)

1. Contract stability (filenames/schemas/protocols)
2. Orchestration simplicity (single loop, explicit state)
3. Correctness/testability (pure helpers, invariants)
4. Performance (avoid duplicate heavy work)
5. Minimal diff/readability

11) Observability & Rollback

- Logs/metrics/counters:
  - None added (timing logs planned under TODO item 6).
- Pointer/evidence to outputs:
  - Existing stdout pointers unchanged.
- Rollback plan:
  - Revert `src/range_processor.rs` to pre-refactor version.

Progress (2025-09-09)

- Implemented range_processor helpers:
  - `resolve_file_rel(...)` and `write_or_print(...)` extracted; simplified `save_range_report`.
  - Built + spacing audit OK; no schema/contract changes.

- Implemented render.rs (unmerged branches) helpers:
  - `collect_unmerged_shas(params, branch)` wraps `gitio::unmerged_commits_in_range`.
  - `write_branch_shards(context, params, label, branch_dir_name, branch_dir, shas)` mirrors main commit loop: process → optional patch save → shard write → manifest items.
  - Updated `process_unmerged_branches` to use the helpers.
  - Built + spacing audit OK; headers OK.

- Implemented github_api.rs extraction (TODO 3, part):
  - Extracted `submitter_email_fallback(commits_json, login)` and refactored `build_submitter_user` to use it.
  - Timestamp resolution helper already present; reused in main PR assembly.
  - Added `PrCommonFields` + `build_common_pr_fields(...)` (number/title/state/body/head/base/urls) and refactored `try_fetch_prs_for_commit` to use it.
  - Build + spacing audit OK.

- Implemented range_windows.rs split (TODO 4, part):
  - Added `normalize_number_word` and bucket builders `buckets_for_last_n_months|weeks`.
  - Refactored `for_phrase_buckets` to use helpers; no behavior changes.

Docs:
- Added rustdoc comments for new helpers and `SaveOutcome`.

Next:
- Consider tiny struct for `(entry, to_print)` in range_processor (TODO 1, optional).
- If approved, proceed to TODO 3 (github_api.rs extraction) or TODO 4 (range_windows.rs split).

Repo Overlay (autogenerated skeleton)

States (define enumerated program states here):
- [fill: e.g., single, multi, write, preview, split, monolithic]

Module Invariants (from file headers):
- src/commit.rs
  - clip_patch preserves UTF-8 boundaries; patch_clipped is accurate
  - body_lines derived when body is non-empty
  - enrichment is best-effort; absence of PRs leaves fields None
- src/util.rs
  - prepare_out_dir returns an existing directory (either provided or temp timestamped)
  - clip_patch never splits UTF-8; indicates clipping accurately
  - format_shard_name pattern is stable and locale-independent
- src/render.rs
  - run_simple returns fully in-memory report consistent with schema
  - run_report returns pointer JSON when split; otherwise full report JSON; file names are stable
  - shard filenames follow YYYY.MM.DD-HH.MM-<shortsha>.json
- src/manifest.rs
  - manifest contains ranges[] in chronological order of entries provided
  - file paths in entries are relative to base_dir and point to report-<label>.json
  - generated_at is serialized in %Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S (local)
- src/main.rs
  - when cfg.multi_windows == true, an overall manifest.json is written and a pointer with {dir, manifest} is printed
  - when cfg.split_apart == true and cfg.multi_windows == false, a pointer {dir, file} is printed for the range report
  - when cfg.split_apart == false and cfg.multi_windows == false, a full JSON report is printed to stdout or written to --out
- src/range_windows.rs
  - resolve_ranges returns at least one range; ForPhrase buckets are ordered earliest→latest
  - month_bounds yields [start_of_month, start_of_next_month]
  - parse_now accepts RFC3339 or naive %Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S and never panics
- src/range_processor.rs
  - base_dir is prepared when split_apart || multi_windows
  - per-range report file name is report-<label>.json when written to disk
  - multi_windows ⇒ manifest.json exists and pointer {dir, manifest} printed
  - single split ⇒ pointer {dir, file} printed; single non-split ⇒ JSON printed or written to --out
- src/cli.rs
  - exactly one window selection is provided: --month | --for | (--since & --until)
  - --detailed implies include_unmerged/include_patch/github_prs
  - out semantics: file path when single non-split; directory when split or multi
- src/enrichment/github_api.rs
  - Never panic; return None/empty on failures (best-effort enrichment)
  - Token discovery prefers GITHUB_TOKEN, then `gh auth token`
  - Origin parser only recognizes GitHub remotes (https or ssh)
- src/enrichment/github_pull_requests.rs
  - On success, preserves existing commit fields; sets URLs if present in first PR; attaches PR list
  - On failure, commit remains valid; fields untouched

Acceptance (checklist to adapt):
- [ ] Program state derived once and stored centrally
- [ ] Outputs mapped to enumerated states
- [ ] Names/shapes stable and test-covered
- [ ] Orchestrator phases clear; IO at edges
- [ ] Invariants defined and asserted
- [ ] Errors include what/where
- [ ] Observability: pointers/ids/paths logged/printed
