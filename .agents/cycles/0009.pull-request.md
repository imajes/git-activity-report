Title: perf: reuse commit results; cache GH calls; synthesize shortstat; compact shards; faster patch save

Summary
- Reuses processed commits in split mode (no second rev-list + loop)
- Caches GitHub origin parsing and remote API calls (details, reviews, commits, users)
- Synthesizes diffstat_text from numstat (drops extra git shortstat call)
- Writes shard JSON compact; keeps pretty formatting for top-level reports
- Saves patch from memory when available (avoids redundant git show)
- Cleans up clippy and maintains spacing invariants

Details
- render
  - process_commit_range now returns (commits, items, summary, authors); run_report reuses commits.
  - Shards are written with serde_json::to_vec; top-level report remains pretty.

- commit
  - Builds diffstat_text from numstat aggregates; omits zero components to match git output.
  - save_patch_to_disk writes from in-memory patch when embed=true and not clipped; falls back to git show otherwise.

- enrichment/github_api + github_pull_requests
  - Added GithubCachedApi wrapper for per-run in-memory caching of: list_pulls_for_commit_json, get_pull_details_json, list_reviews_for_pull_json, list_commits_in_pull_json, list_commits_in_pull (typed), and get_user_json.
  - parse_origin_github caches (owner, repo) per repo path for the lifetime of the process.

- hygiene
  - Clippy: gated commit_shortstat to tests; added type aliases for complex tuple/static types.
  - Spacing audit (strict) passes; module headers present.

Validation
- Tests: 96/96 passing (just test)
- Clippy: clean (just clippy)
- Spacing audit: clean (just audit-spacing-strict)

Notes
- Behavior and schema are unchanged. Shard files are compact JSON instead of pretty; top-level report/manifest remain pretty.
- This reduces git subprocess calls and remote API calls for larger ranges and PR-heavy repos.
