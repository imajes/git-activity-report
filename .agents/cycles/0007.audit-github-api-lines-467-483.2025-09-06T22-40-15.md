# Cycle 0007 — audit github_api lines 467-483 (2025-09-06T22-40-15)


Use this template before editing code. Keep it short and decisive. Save a copy as `$GITROOT/.agents/cycles/<idx>.<short-desc>.<timestamp>.md` to log each cycle.

1) Summary

- Problem/intent: Refactor enrichment code to follow invariants (extract nested access; separate compute vs. mutation; flatten control flow) beginning with github_api.rs lines 467–483 and applying similar cleanups to both enrichment files.
- Deliverables (code/docs/tests): Code refactors in src/enrichment/github_api.rs and src/enrichment/github_pull_requests.rs; tests verifying no behavior change.
- Scope (modules/files/areas): enrichment/github_api.rs, enrichment/github_pull_requests.rs.

2) Context & Constraints

- Context: GitHub enrichment helpers and orchestrators (best-effort, no schema changes).
- Constraints: Maintain JSON contracts and filenames; adhere to spacing/layout rules and keep nesting ≤ 2; no functional changes.

3) State & Invariants

- Derived state: reviewer metrics, approver selection, user emails, PR timestamps, diff/patch URLs.
- Invariants: No panics; optional fields remain optional; compute → blank → assign; never inline complex values into pushes.

4) Inputs → Outputs (Contracts)

- Inputs: env-backed API fixtures; local git origin; GitHub API when token present.
- Outputs: Same JSON model; refactor-only.

5) Orchestration Plan (Phases)

- Phase 1 — Identify nested chains and inline expressions.
- Phase 2 — Extract locals (email_from_user, email_from_commits, created_at_primary, etc.).
- Phase 3 — Replace deep nesting with find_map; separate compute from assignment; keep one-blank separators.
- Finalize — run full test suite to confirm no behavior change.

6) Module/Boundary Plan

- Resolution/parser module(s):
- Processing/orchestrator module(s):
- Assembly/rendering module(s):
- Persistence/manifest module(s):
- Enrichment/integration module(s):
- Utilities/helpers:

7) Side Effects & IO

- Filesystem: none beyond source edits.
- Network/API: none (tests use env seams).
- Subprocess/system: cargo/nextest via just.

8) Testing & Validation

- Ran `just test` → all tests passed; coverage reported.
- Verified previously failing enrichment test stays green.

9) Risks & Trade-offs

- Minimal risk: refactor only; could over-abstract; mitigated by incremental locals and tests.

10) Tie-Breakers (apply in this order)

1. Contract stability (filenames/schemas/protocols)
2. Orchestration simplicity (single loop, explicit state)
3. Correctness/testability (pure helpers, invariants)
4. Performance (avoid duplicate heavy work)
5. Minimal diff/readability

11) Observability & Rollback

- Logs/metrics/counters:
- Pointer/evidence to outputs:
- Rollback plan:

Outcome

- Changes: Extracted nested chains to locals; flattened commit-email fallback via find_map; separated compute and mutation; mirrored patterns in github_pull_requests.rs; clarified created/merged/closed timestamp derivation and approver email resolution.
- Behavior: No functional changes; schema unchanged. Added tests to improve coverage for github_api.rs (token via gh success path, submitter email fallback from commits, reviewer dedup/bot classification/first-review timing).
- Commands: `just test` (passed). Pre-PR: `just fmt`, `just clippy`, `just audit-spacing`, `just check-headers`, `just ci-check`.
 - Commands: `just fmt-fix`, `just audit-spacing-strict` (clean), `just test` (all green). Pre-PR: `just clippy`, `just check-headers`, `just ci-check`.

States (define enumerated program states here):
- [fill: e.g., single, multi, write, preview, split, monolithic]

Modules → Roles (from file headers):
- src/commit.rs: commit construction/enrichment — Construct per-commit objects; enrich with optional PR links; embed or save patches as configured

- src/render.rs: assembly/render — Assemble per-range reports; when split_apart, write commit shards and per-range report, returning a pointer

- src/params.rs: parameter mapping — Translate EffectiveConfig + [since,until] into ReportParams for render
- src/main.rs: entrypoint/orchestrator — Entrypoint orchestrator; normalize → resolve ranges → process ranges; print final JSON or pointer
- src/range_windows.rs: resolution/parser — Resolve time windows into labeled ranges; parse "now" overrides; helpers for natural language buckets
- src/range_processor.rs: processing/orchestrator — Orchestrate per-range processing: generate report JSON and save artifacts; assemble overall manifest for multi-range runs
- src/model.rs: model/types — Define the JSON model (commits, ranges, manifests, GitHub PRs) shared by rendering and enrichment
- src/cli.rs: cli/normalization — Parse CLI flags and produce an EffectiveConfig with consistent defaults and implied flags
- src/ext/mod.rs: module/aggregation — Group extension traits and helpers for third-party crates and std types under a single `ext` namespace
- src/ext/serde_json.rs: extension/serde_json — Provide ergonomic nested JSON fetching via dotted paths and safe typed extraction for serde_json::Value
- src/enrichment/github_api.rs: enrichment/github-api — Isolated GitHub API helpers used by enrichment (token discovery, REST calls)
- src/enrichment/github_pull_requests.rs: enrichment/integration — Best-effort enrichment adding GitHub PR links and PR list to a commit
- src/enrichment/mod.rs: enrichment/namespace — Namespace for enrichment features (GitHub PRs, etc.)

Module Invariants (from file headers):
- src/commit.rs
  - clip_patch preserves UTF-8 boundaries; patch_clipped is accurate
  - body_lines derived when body is non-empty
  - enrichment is best-effort; absence of PRs leaves fields None
- src/util.rs
  - prepare_out_dir returns an existing directory (either provided or temp timestamped)
  - clip_patch never splits UTF-8; indicates clipping accurately
  - format_shard_name pattern is stable and locale-independent
- src/render.rs
  - run_simple returns fully in-memory report consistent with schema
  - run_report returns pointer JSON when split; otherwise full report JSON; file names are stable
  - shard filenames follow YYYY.MM.DD-HH.MM-<shortsha>.json
- src/manifest.rs
  - manifest contains ranges[] in chronological order of entries provided
  - file paths in entries are relative to base_dir and point to report-<label>.json
  - generated_at is serialized in %Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S (local)
- src/params.rs
  - label derives from window type (Month => ym; else "window") unless overridden later
  - split_out is set when out != "-"; otherwise resolved by render
- src/main.rs
  - when cfg.multi_windows == true, an overall manifest.json is written and a pointer with {dir, manifest} is printed
  - when cfg.split_apart == true and cfg.multi_windows == false, a pointer {dir, file} is printed for the range report
  - when cfg.split_apart == false and cfg.multi_windows == false, a full JSON report is printed to stdout or written to --out
- src/range_windows.rs
  - resolve_ranges returns at least one range; ForPhrase buckets are ordered earliest→latest
  - month_bounds yields [start_of_month, start_of_next_month]
  - parse_now accepts RFC3339 or naive %Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S and never panics
- src/range_processor.rs
  - base_dir is prepared when split_apart || multi_windows
  - per-range report file name is report-<label>.json when written to disk
  - multi_windows ⇒ manifest.json exists and pointer {dir, manifest} printed
  - single split ⇒ pointer {dir, file} printed; single non-split ⇒ JSON printed or written to --out
- src/cli.rs
  - exactly one window selection is provided: --month | --for | (--since & --until)
  - --detailed implies include_unmerged/include_patch/github_prs
  - out semantics: file path when single non-split; directory when split or multi
- src/enrichment/github_api.rs
  - Never panic; return None/empty on failures (best-effort enrichment)
  - Token discovery prefers GITHUB_TOKEN, then `gh auth token`
  - Origin parser only recognizes GitHub remotes (https or ssh)
- src/enrichment/github_pull_requests.rs
  - On success, preserves existing commit fields; sets URLs if present in first PR; attaches PR list
  - On failure, commit remains valid; fields untouched

Acceptance (checklist to adapt):
- [ ] Program state derived once and stored centrally
- [ ] Outputs mapped to enumerated states
- [ ] Names/shapes stable and test-covered
- [ ] Orchestrator phases clear; IO at edges
- [ ] Invariants defined and asserted
- [ ] Errors include what/where
